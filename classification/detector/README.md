# Detector Directory

This directory is mainly composed of code from the following github
repository: [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7).

It has some changes, however, mostly relating to the number of
iterations to run for hyperparameter optimization, which was somehow
fixed to `300` by the original authors.
