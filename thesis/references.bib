We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

We show that the multiplicative weight-update rule of Littlestone and Warmuth [10] can be adapted to this mode yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games and prediction of points in ℝn. We also show how the weight-update rule can be used to derive a new boosting algorithm which does not require prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm.},

This research has been done as a first step towards the realization of a recognizer of handwritten characters. The design of the network was suggested by biological systems, especially, the visual systems of cat and monkey. The network is composed of analog threshold elements connected in layers. Each analog threshold element receives inputs from a large number of elements in the neighbouring layers and performs its own special functions. It takes care of one restricted part of the photoreceptor layer, on which an input pattem is presented, and it responds to one particular feature of the input pattem, such as brightness contrast, a dot in the pattern, a line segment of a particular orientation, or an end of the line. This means that the network performs parallel processing of the information. With the propagation of the information through the layered network, the input pattern is successively decomposed into dots, groups of line segments of the same orientation, and the ends of these line segments.},

They are typically viewed as distinct approaches: DPMs are graphical models (Markov random fields), while CNNs are “black-box” non-linear classifiers. In this paper, we show that a DPM can be formulated as a CNN, thus providing a synthesis of the two ideas. Our construction involves unrolling the DPM inference algorithm and mapping each step to an equivalent CNN layer. From this perspective, it is natural to replace the standard image features used in DPMs with a learned feature extractor. We call the resulting model a DeepPyramid DPM and experimentally validate it on PASCAL VOC object detection. We find that DeepPyramid DPMs significantly outperform DPMs based on histograms of oriented gradients features (HOG) and slightly outperforms a comparable version of the recently introduced R-CNN detection system, while running significantly faster.},

  abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”—Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

  abstract = {Machine learning tasks often require a significant amount of training data for the resultant network to perform suitably for a given problem in any domain. In agriculture, dataset sizes are further limited by phenotypical differences between two plants of the same genotype, often as a result of differing growing conditions. Synthetically-augmented datasets have shown promise in improving existing models when real data is not available. In this paper, we employ a contrastive unpaired translation (CUT) generative adversarial network (GAN) and simple image processing techniques to translate indoor plant images to appear as field images. While we train our network to translate an image containing only a single plant, we show that our method is easily extendable to produce multiple-plant field images. Furthermore, we use our synthetic multi-plant images to train several YoloV5 nano object detection models to perform the task of plant detection and measure the accuracy of the model on real field data images. Including training data generated by the CUT-GAN leads to better plant detection performance compared to a network trained solely on real data.},

  abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For \$300\textbackslash times 300\$ input, SSD achieves 72.1\% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for \$500\textbackslash times 500\$ input, SSD achieves 75.1\% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

  abstract = {Plant stress is one of the most significant factors affecting plant fitness and, consequently, food production. However, plant stress may also be profitable since it behaves hormetically; at low doses, it stimulates positive traits in crops, such as the synthesis of specialized metabolites and additional stress tolerance. The controlled exposure of crops to low doses of stressors is therefore called hormesis management, and it is a promising method to increase crop productivity and quality. Nevertheless, hormesis management has severe limitations derived from the complexity of plant physiological responses to stress. Many technological advances assist plant stress science in overcoming such limitations, which results in extensive datasets originating from the multiple layers of the plant defensive response. For that reason, artificial intelligence tools, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have become crucial for processing and interpreting data to accurately model plant stress responses such as genomic variation, gene and protein expression, and metabolite biosynthesis. In this review, we discuss the most recent ML and DL applications in plant stress science, focusing on their potential for improving the development of hormesis management protocols.},

Chapter 4 contains basic definitions and some of the notation to be used in later sections are presented. Parts II and III are devoted to a summary of the established theoretical results obtained to date. Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light. (Author).},

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},

  abstract = {Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Over the past two decades, we have seen a rapid technological evolution of object detection and its profound impact on the entire computer vision field. If we consider today’s object detection technique as a revolution driven by deep learning, then, back in the 1990s, we would see the ingenious thinking and long-term perspective design of early computer vision. This article extensively reviews this fast-moving research field in the light of technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century’s time (from the 1990s to 2022). A number of topics have been covered in this article, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speedup techniques, and recent state-of-the-art detection methods.},
